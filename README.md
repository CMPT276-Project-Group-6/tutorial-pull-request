# tutorial-pull-request-bob

Meanwhile, bob is also making changes to the branches, which means that the branches are diverging. 

Let's say they both made a HELLO WORLD:

Now, let's say... Alice is doing some stuff to the main branch.

And she made changes on her own branch, then made the pull request.

Alice also wants to say HELLO WORLD:

HELLO WORLD!!!

How will those two line conflict?
Suddenly something happened and someone changed main.

# More stuff is added

Bob also added more stuff.
